# Forge x Confluence - Deep Analytics
This project represents a significant achievement in my experience as a software developer. I had the opportunity to work on both the backend and frontend aspects of this project, leveraging the power of the Forge platform and integrating it with Atlassian's Confluence, Jira, and Trello platforms.

## Backend Development

On the backend, I utilized the Forge CLI to create a custom UI app within Atlassian Confluence. This allowed me to extend the functionality of Confluence by incorporating custom UI elements, ultimately enhancing the user experience. It was my first time working with the Forge platform, and it opened up new possibilities for me in terms of extending the capabilities of Atlassian's tools.

## Frontend Development

For the frontend, I employed JavaScript, React, and Node.js to develop the user interface and the app's functionality. This allowed me to craft a seamless and intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to interact with the custom features I added.

## Integration with Atlassian's Tools

One of the project's primary objectives was to improve data-driven insights for our team. To achieve this, I integrated our app with Atlassian's Jira and Trello platforms. This integration was pivotal in streamlining project management, enabling seamless task tracking, and facilitating efficient bug reporting. By tapping into the existing infrastructure, our team could operate more efficiently and gain better insights into our projects.

## Collaborative Approach

Throughout the development process, I collaborated closely with a friend to gather requirements and address any bugs or additional features that surfaced during our discussions. This collaborative approach ensured that the app was tailor-made to meet our specific needs, making it an invaluable addition to our workflow.

## Learning Opportunity

This project provided me with an incredible learning opportunity, especially as it was my first encounter with the Forge platform and integrating with Atlassian's suite of tools. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring these technologies and discovering how they can be harnessed to enhance our team's productivity and data-driven insights.

## Requirements

For those interested in setting up their own Forge project, you can find detailed instructions in the [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) section.

## Quick start

- Modify the app by editing the `src/index.jsx` file.

- Build and deploy your app by running:
```
forge deploy
```

- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running:
```
forge install
```

- For local development, use the `forge tunnel` command to proxy invocations locally:
```
forge tunnel
```

### Notes
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
